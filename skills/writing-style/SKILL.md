# Writing Style for Decision Artifacts

Apply these principles to all decision outputs. Choose shortform or longform based on artifact type.

## When to Use Each

| Artifact | Style | Typical Length |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Executive Summary | Shortform | 1 page / 250 words |
| Email/Memo | Shortform | 3-5 sentences |
| Business Case | Longform | 10-20 pages |
| M&A Memo/CIM | Longform | 20-30 pages |
| Full Decision Artifact | Longform | 5-15 pages |
| Counter-Case | Shortform | 2-3 pages |

## Shortform: Executive Style

**Tone:** Confident, approachable, actionable.

### Core Rules

1. **Front-load decisions** - Inverted pyramid. Key info first.
2. **Active voice** - Strong verbs. No passive constructions.
3. **Positive framing** - Focus on solutions, not problems.
4. **Short paragraphs** - 3 lines max. Bullets for lists.
5. **Clear CTA** - What decision or action is needed?
6. **Concrete numbers** - Quantify claims. No vague language.
7. **No jargon** - Unless industry-standard.

### Structure: 1-Page Memo

```
SUBJECT: [Decision-oriented, 6-8 words]

PURPOSE: [1 sentence - why are we here]

BACKGROUND: [2-3 sentences - context only]

RECOMMENDATION: [Bold. Clear. Actionable.]

RISKS/ALTERNATIVES:
- [Bulleted]
- [Concise]

NEXT STEPS:
- [Who] will [what] by [when]
```

### Email Format

- **Subject:** 6-8 words, action/results focused
- **Body:** 3-5 sentences + bullets
- **Tone:** Positive, clear ask, specific deadline
- **Close:** Direct + contact info

## Longform: Strategic Style

**Tone:** Strategic, authoritative, data-driven.

### Core Rules

1. **Executive Summary first** - 1 page max. Problem, Recommendation, Financials, CTA.
2. **Structured sections** - Clear headers, logical flow.
3. **Data-driven** - Charts, tables, metrics throughout.
4. **Rationale explicit** - Don't assume reader agrees; justify.
