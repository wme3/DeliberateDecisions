# Founding AE Hire: Business Case

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** Hire a founding AE ($150-200K OTE) to accelerate growth from $500K to $2M ARR

**Why now:** Series A readiness requires $2M ARR in 18 months; founder-led sales is unsustainable at current intensity

**Expected outcome:** Proven, scalable sales motion and $2M ARR positioning for Series A

**Investment:** $150-200K OTE (2-3% of $5M seed)

**Ask:** Commit to 2-week talent validation, then execute hire

---

## Background

### The Opportunity

We have strong fundamentals:
- $500K ARR with 5 stable customers (zero churn risk)
- $200K ACV demonstrating enterprise value
- 25% close rate proving product-market fit with early adopters
- 20 qualified deals in pipeline ($4M potential at 25% = $1M)
- 3 new deals/month inbound generation

The math to $2M ARR works. The execution path is the question.

### Why Now

**Series A readiness:** $2M ARR is the target. We have 18 months.

**Founder capacity is maxed:**
- 20-30 hours/week on sales already
- Product, recruiting, and fundraising all suffering
- Current pace is unsustainable for 18 months

**Investors will ask:** "What happens when you're not the one selling?"

If our answer is "we don't know" - that's a weaker raise. We need to prove scalable sales before Series A, not after.

## The Opportunity

### Proposed Approach

**Hire a founding AE** - a senior account executive with startup DNA who can:
- Learn our sale in 30 days working alongside founder
- Identify and close early adopters (not educate the market)
- Operate independently for 12 months
- Step into sales leadership post-Series A

**Profile:** Not a junior AE (needs too much support). Not a VP Sales (wrong stage). A player-coach who can both carry quota and eventually build a team.

**Compensation:** $150-200K OTE - competitive for the profile, sustainable for our stage.

### Key Benefits

1. **Founder leverage** - Reclaim 20-30 hrs/week for product, recruiting, and Series A prep
2. **Proven scale** - Demonstrate sales works without founder before raising
3. **Knowledge transfer** - Reduce single point of failure risk
4. **Leadership pipeline** - AE becomes sales leader post-raise

### Strategic Alignment

This directly enables our Series A:
- $2M ARR target becomes achievable
- "Scalable sales" checkbox gets checked
- Founder available for fundraising process
- Less risky investment thesis for Series A investors

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Why Not Selected |
|--------|------|------|------------------|
| VP Sales ($200K+) | Experience, builds team | Wrong stage per reference class; VPs hired at $2M ARR | Too senior |
| Junior AE ($100-150K) | Lower cost | Needs process that doesn't exist; can't close without founder | Not ready for this |
| Founder-led (no hire) | No hiring risk | Unsustainable; can't prove scale; burnout | Already maxed out |
| Partnerships | Scalable if works | 12+ months to build; no motion today | Not ready |

**Reference class confirms:** Founding AE is the right hire at $500K ARR. VP Sales is a $2M ARR hire.

## Risk Assessment

### Key Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Wrong hire (market educator) | Medium | High | Rigorous screening for "early adopter hunter" profile |
| AE can't close $200K deals | Medium | High | Test complexity handling in interviews; reference checks |
| Insufficient onboarding time | Medium | Medium | Block calendar before hire; document sales motion |
| AE leaves before Series A | Low-Medium | High | Equity vesting; clear path to sales leadership |

### What We've Stress-Tested

- **Pre-mortem analysis:** 5 failure scenarios examined, mitigations identified
- **Alternatives evaluation:** 5 options rigorously compared
- **Reference class:** Industry benchmarks confirm timing and profile
- **Contrarian challenge:** Steel-manned founder-led and no-hire options

### Exit Criteria

If the following occur, we will reassess:
- No qualified candidates after 60 days of searching
- AE close rate below 15% at month 6
- AE leaves before month 9

These are pre-committed tripwires - not excuses to rationalize later.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeline |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| ARR | $500K | $2M | 18 months |
| Founder sales time | 20-30 hrs/week | <10 hrs/week | Month 6 |
| AE close rate | N/A | ≥20% | Month 6+ |
| Pipeline coverage | 20 deals | 30+ deals | Month 12 |

### How We'll Know It's Working

**Month 1-3:** AE ramping, founder still closing current pipeline
**Month 4-6:** AE independently managing deals, first closes expected
**Month 6-12:** AE carrying meaningful quota, founder freed for other priorities
**Month 12+:** AE transitioning to leadership, ready to hire junior AEs
