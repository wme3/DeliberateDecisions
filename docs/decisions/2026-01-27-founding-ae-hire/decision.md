# Decision: How to Reach $2M ARR in 18 Months

## Executive Summary

**Decision:** Validate founding AE hire through 2-week talent market test, then commit or adapt

**Recommendation:** Hire a founding AE ($150-200K OTE) with emerging category / early market experience

**Confidence:** Medium

**Key bet:** The right founding AE can learn our sale in 30 days and close early adopters at near-founder rate

## Thesis Gate Summary

**Decision Statement:** How do we grow from $500K to $2M ARR in 18 months to be Series A ready?

**Trigger:** Series A requires $2M ARR; 18-month runway from $5M seed

**Current State:**
- $500K ARR
- 5 customers, no churn risk
- 20 deals in pipeline
- 3 deals/month generation
- $200K ACV
- 25% close rate
- 20-person team
- Founder spending 20-30 hrs/week on sales

**Stakeholders:**
- Decider: Founder (sole decision)
- Affected: Team, investors, customers

**Constraints:**
- 18-month timeline
- $5M seed runway
- Founder capacity maxed

**Success Criteria:** $2M ARR by month 18

**Reversibility:** Moderate - 6 months to evaluate hire, costly but doable to exit

## Landscape Gate Summary

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Description | Verdict |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **A. Sales Leader ($200K+ OTE)** | VP-level hire | Wrong stage - reference class says VP at $2M, not $500K |
| **B. Junior AE ($100-150K OTE)** | Founder leads, AE executes | Rejected - low confidence on all assumptions |
| **C. Founder-led sales** | No hire, founder closes all deals | Math works, sustainability doesn't |
| **D. Product-led growth** | Self-serve motion | Not applicable to $200K ACV enterprise |
| **E. Partnerships/channels** | Resellers, integrations | Not ready - 12+ months out |
| **F. Founding AE ($150-200K OTE)** | Senior AE with leadership upside | **Selected** - medium confidence, reference class supports |

### Decision Points

| ID | Statement | Type | Confidence |
|----|-----------|------|------------|
| DP1 | Founding AE profile exists in enterprise cyber at target comp | assumption | Medium |
| DP2 | Right person can learn our sale in 30 days | assumption | Medium-High |
| DP3 | AE can close at near-founder rate (≥20%) | assumption | Medium |
| DP4 | Founder can commit 30 days to onboarding | assumption | Medium |
| DP5 | Inbound pipeline continues at 3/month | assumption | Medium |
| DP6 | AE stays through Series A | assumption | Medium |
| DP7 | Founder-led is sustainable for 18 months | assumption | Low |

### Decision Intersections

- DP2 **depends on** DP1 (can't train if can't find)
- DP3 **depends on** DP2 (can't close if not trained)
- DP7 **conflicts with** current reality (already maxed at 20-30 hrs/week)

### Knowns/Unknowns

**Known:**
- Current metrics (ARR, ACV, close rate, pipeline)
- Founder capacity is maxed
- Reference class supports founding AE at this stage

**Unknown-Knowable:**
- Does founding AE profile exist at target comp?
- Can we identify early adopter hunter vs market educator?

**Unknown-Unknowable:**
- Will AE close at founder rate?
- Will AE stay through Series A?

## Research Gate Summary

### Key Findings

| Question | Answer | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Churn risk | None - 5 customers stable | Internal |
| Founder capacity | 20-30 hrs/week on sales, everything else suffers | Internal |
| Deal cycle | 3-6 months | Internal |
| Pipeline source | Inbound (holds) + founder outbound (transferable) | Internal |
| First sales hire timing | Founding AE at $500K ARR, VP at $2M ARR | Reference class |
| ACV threshold for AE | $5-10K minimum, we're at $200K | Reference class |

### Reference Class

**Source:** First Round Review, SaaStr, industry benchmarks

**Key insights:**
- VP Sales typically hired at ~$2M ARR, not $500K
- Common mistake: hiring too senior too early
- Founding AE profile: startup experience, thrives in ambiguity, builds process
- "Your first AE is not just selling your product—they're building your sales engine"

### Critical Context

We're in an **emerging segment of cybersecurity**:
- Early adopters only - people who have the pain and want to solve it NOW
- Not ready for "market education" approach
- Must find prospects, not convince them
- This narrows the founding AE profile significantly

### Facts (Verified)

| Statement | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| Current ARR: $500K | Internal |
| Target: $2M ARR in 18 months | Internal |
| ACV: $200K | Internal |
| Close rate: 25% | Internal |
| Pipeline: 20 deals | Internal |
| Generation: 3/month | Internal |
| Deal cycle: 3-6 months | Internal |
| Customers: 5, no churn risk | Internal |
| Team: 20 people | Internal |
| Seed: $5M raised | Internal |
| Founder time on sales: 20-30 hrs/week | Internal |
| Founding AE typical at $500K ARR | Reference class |

### Assumptions (Unverified)

| Assumption | Confidence | Evidence | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Founding AE profile exists and is findable | Medium | None - untested | Plan fails |
| 30-day onboarding works | Medium-High | Founder experience | Delay, missed targets |
| AE closes at near-founder rate | Medium | None - untested | Revenue miss |
| AE stays through Series A | Medium | Depends on person | Knowledge loss |
| 30 days available for onboarding | Medium | Calendar packed | AE fails |

### Critical Risks

**Founder burnout without hire:**
- Confidence: Low on sustainability
- Impact: Company-wide
- Already seeing: "everything suffers" from context switching

### Blind Spots

1. **Founding AE exists and is findable** - No evidence, haven't searched
2. **AE can close at founder rate** - Zero data points
3. **30-day onboarding sufficient** - 3-6 month cycle means won't know for 4-7 months

## Contrarian Gate Summary

### Pre-Mortem: Failure Scenarios

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Wrong hire** | Enterprise seller who wants to educate market, not find early adopters. 6 months wasted. |
| **Right hire, wrong timing** | Can't carve out 30 days, half-trained AE fails |
| **AE leaves** | Gets poached at month 8, knowledge walks out |
| **Pipeline dries up** | Inbound drops, not enough deals to feed AE |
| **Opportunity cost** | Should have spent $150K on demand gen instead |

**Biggest fear:** Wrong hire - specifically, someone who wants to educate the market vs. find early adopters who already have the pain.

### Steel-Manned Alternatives

**Case for Founder-Led:**
> "You know the pain better than anyone. You can spot early adopters in 5 minutes. A founding AE will waste months learning what you already know. Just grind for 18 months, hire after Series A from strength."

**Counter:** If founder does all selling through Series A, no one knows the business to scale post-raise. Investors will ask "what happens when you're not selling?" and the answer is "I don't know yet" - weak positioning.

**Case for Not Hiring:**
> "You haven't validated the profile exists. Could burn $100K+ and 6 months on wrong hire. Keep cash, grind to $1.5M, raise smaller A or bridge."

**Counter:** $100K is 2% of seed - a small bet to prove sales scalability before Series A. Even a failed hire teaches you something.

### Bias Audit

| Bias | Status |
|------|--------|
| Confirmation | ✅ Steel-manned alternatives |
| Anchoring | ✅ Pivoted from VP to founding AE |
| Overconfidence | ⚠️ "Medium confidence" untested |
| Planning fallacy | ⚠️ 30-day ramp may be optimistic |

### Second-Order Effects

**If hire succeeds:**
- Founder freed for product, recruiting, fundraising
- Series A positioning strengthens
- AE becomes sales leader post-raise

**If hire fails:**
- $100K+ spent, 6 months lost
- Founder more burned out than before
- Harder to recruit next AE

### Decision Killers

None fatal. One to validate: founding AE profile exists at target comp.

## Synthesis Gate Summary

### Must-Be-True Conditions

| # | Condition | Consequence if False |
|---|-----------|----------------------|
| 1 | Founding AE profile exists at $150-200K OTE | Plan fails |
| 2 | Can identify early adopter hunter in interviews | Wrong hire |
| 3 | 30 days available for onboarding | AE set up to fail |
| 4 | AE closes at ≥20% rate | Need more pipeline |
| 5 | Inbound holds at 3/month | Not enough deals |
| 6 | AE stays 12+ months | Knowledge loss |

### Exit Criteria (Pre-Committed)

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| No qualified candidates | 60 days searching | Abort, reassess |
| AE pipeline activity | <5 opps by day 60 | Performance conversation |
| AE close rate | <15% at month 6 | Exit decision |
| AE tenure | Leaves before month 9 | Don't backfill, reassess |
| Founder onboarding time | Can't commit 30 days | Delay hire |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Wrong hire | Medium | High | Rigorous interview for early-adopter hunting |
| Can't close $200K deals | Medium | High | Test in interviews, reference checks |
| Insufficient onboarding | Medium | Medium | Document sales motion before hire |
| AE leaves before Series A | Low-Medium | High | Equity vesting, leadership path |
| Pipeline drops | Low | Medium | Monitor monthly, founder backfills |

**Overall Risk Profile:** Medium-High (acceptable given alternative)

### Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION:** Hire founding AE with 2-week validation first

**CONFIDENCE:** Medium

**RATIONALE:** Founder-led is mathematically viable but unsustainable. Reference class supports founding AE at $500K ARR. Wrong hire risk is real but mitigable. $100-150K is 2-3% of seed - acceptable bet to prove sales scalability.

## Decision

**DECIDED:** Validate first, then commit

**DATE:** January 27, 2026

**CHOSEN PATH:** 2-week talent market test before committing to founding AE hire

**RATIONALE:**
Biggest blind spot is whether founding AE profile exists. 2 weeks of validation costs nothing but time and prevents committing to search that may not yield right candidate.

**DECIDING FACTORS:**
- $100K acceptable bet, but wrong hire is nightmare
- 2 weeks validation is cheap insurance
- If profile doesn't exist, need to adapt before wasting months

**REMAINING CONCERNS:**
- Calendar packed - will validation actually happen?
- "Good" in validation not fully defined

**NEXT REVIEW:** End of 2-week validation period

---

## Validation Plan

**Objective:** Confirm founding AE profile exists at $150-200K OTE with emerging cyber / early market experience

**Actions:**

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Post role or stealth search | Get inbound signal |
| Reach out to 10-15 candidates | Test supply |
| Conduct 5+ screening calls | Assess quality |
| Talk to 2-3 founders who hired this profile | Reference the reference class |

**Success Criteria:**
- 3+ candidates who fit profile
- At least 1 you'd be excited about
- Confidence more exist

**If Validation Fails:**
- No qualified candidates → Reassess comp, profile, or founder-led
- Only market educators → Founder-led until category matures
